//first attempt to write a C function
void *memcpy ( void *dest, const void *src, size_t n ) 
{
// read on internet "const void *" points no memory that should not be modified. 
// "void *" points to memoery that could be modified. 
// googled "size_t" is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit
    while ( n-- ) 
        *dest++ == *src++ ;
// return is ok?
    return ;

void *malloc ( size_t size, size_t alignment_size ) 
{
// googled malloc and found one tutorial that says malloc should
//    1) reutnr a pointer to the payload of memory size, size, of memory block
//    2) this memory is off-limmits to the DMA until release by user
//        - How is 2) guaranteed? Firmware?
// after reading some stuff online 30 minute time ran out and I was not able to come of up a good solution for this
// I need
     1.) a function that search and find a section of memorty of size "size" that is free. 
     2.) make sure the above free memory start at an alignment determined by alignment_size 
     3.) make sure DMA or anyone else will not access the memory
     4.) return pointer to the mmeory.
